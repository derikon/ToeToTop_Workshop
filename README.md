# Sustainable Haptic Design @ CHI2022

This repository hosts the code for the website of the [Sustainable Haptic Design workshop](https://tactilevision.github.io/chi2022-sustainablehapticdesign/) at the [CHI 2022](https://chi2022.acm.org/) conference.


## Abstract

Haptic devices have been around for decades, providing critical information, usability benefits and improved experiences across taskslike surgical operations to playful applications in Mixed Reality. We see more and more software and hardware solutions emergingthat provide design tools, design approaches and platforms, both in academia and industry. We believe that often, however, designersare re-inventing the wheel, and must spend an inordinate amount of time doing their work, which is not sustainable for long termresearch. This workshop aims at gathering people from academia and industry to provide a common ground to discuss various insightson and visions of the field. We aim to bring together the various strands of haptics - devices, software, and design - to assess the currentstate-of-the-art and propose an agenda towards haptics as a united design discipline. We expect the outcome of the workshop to be acomprehensive overview of existing tools and approaches, along with recommendations on how to move the field forward, together.
